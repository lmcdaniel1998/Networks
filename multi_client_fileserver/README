Fileserver Programs:

Building:
	type 'make' or 'make all' to build server and rcopy programs

Usage:
	Server:
		can take in one input specifying the server socket
		>> ./server [error rate] (optional) [socket num]

	Rcopy:
		run with following input:
		>> ./rcopy [server file] [rcoy file] [window size] [buffer size] [error rate] [server address] [server port]

Description:

	Server:
		This program is able to transfer files from its immediate directory
		to rcopy clients. The server transfers the file data using the 
		sliding window protocol with ARQ error recovery. It can handle
		multiple clients with the use of forked clients.

	Rcopy:
		This program is able to download files from a file transfer server.
		The client specifies the window and buffer sizes for the file transfer.
		File transfer is done with a sliding window protocol with ARQ error recovery.

Possible Errors:

	Sometimes on larger files with high error rates, the last packet or so is not
	written to the rcopy file.
